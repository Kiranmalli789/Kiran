## Introduction

Now-a-days among different memory elements SRAM(Static Random Access Memory) became very popular because of their high speed operations and low power consumption.
The most common SRAM cell used in todays applications are 6T SRAM.Even through it has low power consumption and high speed operation compared other memory elements
like DRAM,the read operation in 6T SRAM is still slow because of the time taken by the access transistors to access the memory part(latch) of the SRAM, which 
further results in increase of leakage power.So,In this paper we have discussed about the 10T SRAM which has low leakage power, high read operation speed,avoid 
noise in read operation and solves the limitations of conventional 6T SRAM.

## Circuit Design and Details

The 10T SRAM circuit is shown in fig.1.This circuit avoids the read operation noise by isolating the memory part(latch) of the cell from external environment by 
disabling the access transistors during read operation and the memory read operation is done by additing additional circuit connected to the Qb.By this process we can
also improve the read operation speed of SRAM since we are not using access transistors for measuring memory read operation and hence the leakage current is decreased.

### * Circuit Operation

There are three modes of operation of 10T SRAM:

1.Stand-by mode: When Wordline(WL) = 0 and Read enable(RE) = 0,then the memory part became isolated from external environment and the data present in it remains same.
                 Therefore no read or write operation takes place.

2.Memory Read: When RE=1, then the Transmission gate is in active condition and the RDout gets the inverted value of Q(i.e, Qb) through the Transmission gates.

3.Memory write: When WL=1, then the write operation is possible.If BL=0, then PM0 transistor will "ON" and Qb becomes 1 and Q becomes 0.
                Similarly  if BL=1,then Q becomes 1 and Qb becomes 0.

Since Memory write operation still uses the access transistors unlike Memory operation, the Memory write operation will be slower when compared to memory read operation.

The main advantage of this 10T SRAM is that it doesn't require the precharge capacitors connected to a sense amplifier for memory read/write operation as that of 6T SRAM,
because here the data stored in memory is directly passes through the inverter and transmision gates.And also the charging or discharging of RDout happens only when the 
RDout changes,i.e, there is no power is consumed or dissipated if the next data is same as that of previous value.Therefore, this design of 10T SRAM reduces the 
consumption of when consecutive readout values are same.

## Simulation Waveforms

As we have discussed earlier when WL=1,then the write operation is possible and the Q gets the BL value and Qb gets the inverted value of Q.And when RE=1 and REB=0, then 
the Transmission gate is active state and it passes the inverted Q(i.e,Qb) to the RD terminal.
